The inhabitants are principally engaged in the corn trade, some in agricultural tool making, and others in making windows, chairs, bricks, &c. Is interesting historically as the place where King Charles I. tried to negotiate with Parliament in 1645. It was also occupied by Oliver Cromwell, in 1647--the Crown Inn replacing the old one where he held his head quarters.

In the vicinity are *Swakeley's* (1½ mile), and a short walk beyond is *Harefield*, frequently visited by Milton; and crossing the Colne to *Chalfont St. Giles*, may be seen the house where I the blind bard wrote ins "Paradise Regained,"--returning by Denham, so well described by Davy, in his "Salmonia."

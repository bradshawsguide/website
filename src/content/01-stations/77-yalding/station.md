text: Distance from station, 1½ mile.

A telegraph station.

The village of Yalding is not remarkable for anything of interest to the traveller. A short distance from it are Yalding Downs and Barnes Hill; and to the left of the station there are several country seats and mansions, in most beautiful parks.

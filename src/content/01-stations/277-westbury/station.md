text: This is an ancient borough, with a malting and broad cloth trade. Bryan Edwards, the historian, was a native. About two miles north-east is an ancient encampment, on the edge of the chalk downs near *Bralton*; on the escarpment below it is the figure of a white horse, the origin of which is doubtful and obscure. Four miles beyond is *Erie Stoke Park*, the seat of Lord Broughton. We now bear to the left, leaving the Weymouth line, on the [Salisbury Branch](/routes/westbury-to-salisbury).

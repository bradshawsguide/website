text: Many of our readers may not be aware that this spot, and the whole neighbourhood, is the classic ground of England, and replete with historical associations of surpassing interest. From the Downs to the north of the village of Minster there is a prospect of great extent and singular beauty. Not only may the Isle of Thanet, with all its churches save one, be seen at a glance, but in the distance are perceptible the towers of Reculver, the Isle of Sheppy, the Downs and town of Deal, the bay and town of Sandwich, the champaign districts of East Kent, the spires of Woodnesborough and Ash, the ruins of Richborough, the green levels of Minster and Saltpans, watered by the Stour, and far on the land horizon at the head of the valley the stately towers of Canterbury Cathedral, the picture finishing with a sweep of hills which spread north and south to the extent of one hundred miles.

Minster is a delightful looking village, and exceedingly interesting. The fine old church is said to be the oldest Christian church in England. The interior has been recently restored, and is very beautiful.

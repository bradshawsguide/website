Population, 7,075, who send two members to parliament. A little cloth and silk are made. It has two tanneries, a foundry, four banks, a new Town Hall and Market House, built for £12,000, at the cost of J. Neeld, Esq., M. P., of Grittleton, and a long bridge on 23 arches. The old church large and handsome. In the time of Alfred it was a city of strength, and was taken by the Danes in 8S0. It is delightfully situated in a valley on the south bank of the river Avon, by which it is almost surrounded.

In the neighbourhood are *Lacock Abbey*, seat of--Talbot, Esq., the inventor of Photography; *Bowood*, the seat of the Marquis of Lansdowne; *Sloperton*, formerly the seat of Moore, who died in 1852, and is buried at Bromham, near Spye Park, the Starkies' seat.

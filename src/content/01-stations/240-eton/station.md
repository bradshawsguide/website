text: Eton is celebrated for its college, founded in 1440, by Henry VI., to which resort annually about 850 students, chiefly the sons of noble and opulent families. The triennial celebration of *Eton Montem* on Salt Hill, but now discontinued, the "salt," or money, given to the captain of the school, for his support at the University, frequently realising nearly a thousand pounds. Passing over a neat bridge, which connects Eton with Windsor, the visitor will enter the town, associated with historical and literary reminiscences of the highest interest. A description of [Windsor Castle](/stations/windsor) appears in Section I.

The scenery around Windsor is remarkable for its sylvan beauty; and the weary citizen, who desires to enjoy a summer holiday, cannot do better than procure an admission ticket to Windsor Castle from the printsellers, Messrs. Comaghi, of Pall Mall, and then make his way to the Great Western Railway, in time for an early train. Within the next three hours he may see all the regal splendours of the palatial halls of Windsor; and then, having refreshed the inward man at any of the "hostelries" which abound in that town, he may stroll forth into the country, and contrast the quiet and enduring charms of nature with the more glittering productions of art, with which wealth and power surround themselves. He may walk in the shades of the forest, sung by Pope; he may saunter over Datchet Mead, immortalised by Shakspeare, in his story of Jack Falstaff and the buck-basket; or he may prolong his stroll to the quiet village of Horton, where Milton lived, and sang its rural charms in the immortal rhymes of "L'Allegro" and "Il Penseroso."

text: One of the old rotten boroughs, once of considerable importance, now displaying few traces of its former superiority beyond its old castle, which was granted by the Conqueror to William de Brasse, and which, after passing the severest ordeals by war and the elements, was at last destroyed during the parliamentarian war. It has a most picturesque appearance from the Adur, which runs at the foot of the mound on which it stands, grimly frowning over the tops of the trees, which are nearly carried to its summit The view from it is a singularly fine one, embracing both land and sea to the verge of the horizon.

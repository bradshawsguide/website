text: Prettily situated on the Wiltshire Downs by the side of the river Kennet, where a Collegiate School is planted; and near which (at Tisbury), Jay, of Bath, was born, 1769. He was placed in the academy of the excellent Cornelius Winter (whom Bishop Jebb styles a "celestial creature") at Marlboro, and went out before he was sixteen to preach to the poor despised rustics. "Our prudent tutor taught us not to rail or abuse, but simply to preach the gospel, and to avoid the offence of *folly*, when we could not avoid that of the cross." Three years after he commenced
his long career at Bath.

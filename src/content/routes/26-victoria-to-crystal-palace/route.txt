text: For the convenience of the inhabitants of Belgravia and the west end of London, a line has been formed to run from Victoria Station, Chelsea, via [Battersea](/stations/battersea), [New Wandsworth](/stations/new-wandsworth), [Balham](/stations/balham) (where a direct line crosses *Tooting Common*, *Streatham Park*, via [Thorton Heath](/stations/thorton-heath), and [Sellhurst](/stations/sellhurst) to the [West Croydon](/stations/west-croydon) station), [Streatham](/stations/streatham), at which there is a tunnel, [Lower Norwood](/stations/lower-norwood), and [Gipsey Hill](/stations/gipsey-hill) to the Crystal Palace. The scenery along the line is remarkable for its fertility and beauty. It joins the [Brighton main line](london-bridge-to-brighton) from [London Bridge](/stations/london-bridge) at Norwood Junction, a little below the Palace.

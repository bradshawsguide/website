text: The **South Devon and Tavistock** line takes a northerly direction from Plymouth, and passes the Stations of [Marsh Mills](/stations/marsh-mills), 4 miles, [Bickleigh](/stations/bickleigh), 3¾ miles, and [Horrabridge](/stations/horrabridge), 4¾ miles, to the town of [Tavistock](/stations/tavistock).

On passing [Marytavy](/stations/marytavy), 3¼ miles, and [Lidford](/stations/lidford), 3¼ further, the line curves to the west, passes [Coryton](/stations/coryton), 4½ miles, and [Lifton](/stations/lifton), 3¼ miles, soon after which we cross the Tamar and enter the county of Cornwall.

A distance of 4½ miles beyond Lifton, and about two from the river, brings us to the county town of [Launceston](/stations/launceston).

text: ## London to Slough

The *Metropolitan Terminus* of the Great Western Railway is situated on the western side of the Paddington Canal, in a line with Praed-street, Paddington, at the north-west extremity of London, and at a short distance from the northern avenues to Hyde Park, thus affording an easy access to and from all parts of town. Omnibuses leave the City one hour before the departure of each train, and call at all the booking-offices on their way, winch, in addition to the cabs, leave the passenger at no loss for a prompt conveyance to this Terminus--one of the largest and most commodious stations in London. Its external appearance is not very remarkable,--but the booking-offices are convenient, the waiting rooms comfortable, the platforms, for the arrival and departure trains, spacious enough to accommodate the largest number of excursionists ever accumulated,--and the vast area embraced by the immense roofs by which the station is covered, impart to the mind of the traveller the impression that he is about to start by the railway of a first-rate company.

It is the joint work of Messrs. Brunei and M. D. Wyatt, the former having arranged the general plan, engineering, and business portion; the latter the architectural details in every department. The principle adopted by them, was to avoid any recurrence to existing styles and to make the experiment of designing everything in accordance with the structural purpose or nature of the materials employed—iron and cement. The office buildings are 580 feet long, varying from thirty to forty in width. The departments for directing and managing the affairs of the Company are carried on in the upper portion of the building, and those in connection with the traffic to and from the station in the lower part.

The space occupied by the platforms and lines of railway under the curved roofing is 700 feet long, and 240 feet six inches wide, and contains four platforms and ten lines of railway The two platforms on the departure side of the station are respectively twenty-seven feet and twenty-four feet six inches wide; and the other two, on the arrival side, are twenty-one feet and forty-seven inches. The latter is of stone. The rooting over the above space is divided into three longitudinal openings, with two transepts, each fifty feet wide, at one-third and two-thirds of the length, the length of which are each 700 feet, and their respective widths seventy feet, 102 feet six inches, and sixty-eight feet. The central half of the curved roofs is glazed, and the other portion is covered with corrugated galvanized iron. The work was done by Messrs. Fox, Henderson, and Co.

On the departure of the train, it threads the sinuosities of the station at an easy rate, and we have time to notice the metamorphosis that has taken place in the em-irons of the line; walls have become green embankments, embankments diminished into hedges, and bodges grown into avenues of trees, waving a leafy adieu as we are carried past, The increasing velocity of the train now conveys us rapidly into the suburbs of the metropolis--past Kensal Green Cemetery on the right, Wormwood Scrubs on the left, and a transient glimpse is obtained of the London and North-Western Railway winding its course towards the midland counties.

The route at first lies through the Thames Valley, then, after passing the. elevated plains to the north of Marborough Downs, it gradually descends down into the fertile and picturesque valley of the Avon. Emerging from a slight excavation, we came to an embankment crossing Old Oak Common so named from its having been the site of a thick forest of oaks. The village of Acton, which lies to the left is linked to the metropolis by one almost uninterrupted line of houses, through which the North-Western Junction Railway passes, connecting the North-Western Railway with those of the South-Western.

## Slough to Maidenhead
Between the lofty and luxuriant foliage of Stoke Park, about two miles to the right of Slough, may be descried, modestly peering through the surrounding trees, the spire of Stoke Pogis Church, the scene of Gray's "Elegy." The following inscription to his memory is on the east wall of the church:--"Opposite to this stone, in the same tomb upon which he has so feelingly recorded his grief at the loss of a beloved parent, lie deposited the remains of Thomas Gray, the author of the 'Elegy written in a Country Churchyard,' &c, &c, &c. He was buried August 6th, 1771." The church itself has no internal beauty, being over-crowded with pews; but the churchyard is one of the prettiest in England. The cloister is worth a visit. As the train proceeds, the broad and verdant fields spread out on each side of us in all the pride of luxuriant vegetation.

Burnham Village is close by, situate in the midst of picturesque woodland scenery, popularised by the adventures of Albert Smith's Mr. Ledbury.

## Maidenhead to Reading
Upon leaving Maidenhead the railway soon spans, by a bridge, of ten arches, the river Thames which here glides through a flat, but most charming country. Having crossed the Windsor road, and diverged gradually to the southward we suddenly dip into an excavation of considerable depth; the characteristic chalky sides of which are replete with geological interest. This cutting, which continues for upwards of five miles, completely shuts out the surrounding country; but coming suddenly upon the Ruscombe embankment, we are amply repaid by a magnificent expanse of landscape. Hill and dale, dotted with elegant villas and noble mansions, woodland and water scenery, together with wide far-stretching meadow and corn-land, follow each other in varied succession to the very verge of the horizon. We have scarcely had time, however, to feast our vision with this delightful prospect, before we are again buried in a cutting, though of shorter duration, and through this we reach the station at Twyford.

Within a few minutes after quitting the station, we emerge from the excavation, and cross, on an embankment, the river Loddon. From this we enter into another cutting of great depth conducting us to an embankment which affords a pleasing view of the county bordering on the woody lands of Oxfordshire. Crossing, on a level embankment, the river Kennet, we soon after reach the station at Reading.

## Reading to Didcot
Passing slowly from the station at a pace that affords us a pleasing bird's eye view of the town, we are earned forward on the same level embankment, and crossing the valley of the Thames soon reach the Roebuck excavation. An embankment, followed by a brief though deep cutting, through the grounds of Purley Park, gives us some charming prospects on the Oxfordshire side, with a mass of woodland scenery scattered over the undulating ground, and cresting even the high summits of the Mapledurham hills beyond.

## Didcot to Swindon Junction
Leaving Didcot on a rise of seven feet in a mile, we now enter an excavation of about half-a-mile, and emerging thence, bend gradually to the west on an embankment, when again plunging into a short cutting, we are carried past Milton, a small village to the left, and in a few minutes afterwards stop at Steventon.

## Swindon to Chippenham.
About a mile to the left is the market town which gives its name to the station, and which is now rapidly rising into importance. The old town is pleasantly situated on the summit of a considerable eminence, commanding extensive views of Berkshire and Gloucestershire.

The line here continues on a rapid descent, of about seven feet in a mile, and by embankment crosses several roads, leading from the neighbouring towns and villages. About a mile to the right, is Lydiard, near which can be recognised the lofty trees of the park, the ancient seat of the Bolingbroke family. Sweeping in rather a serpentine course over a richly-cultivated country, we next pass in succession a cluster of small hamlets to our left; and looking forward, scenery of that quiet pastoral description so characteristic of English rural life is continued to the very verge of the horizon.

## Chippenham to Yatton
Leaving the Chippenham station we continue for some time on an embankment, and then dipping into an excavation we arrive at [Corsham](/stations/corsham).

Shortly after leaving this station we enter the Box Tunnel which is upwards of one mile and three quarters in length, through the solid heart and immense mass of Box Hill. At intervals a gleam of light appears down the shafts that have been cut through the rock to the surface above. Emerging once more into daylight we proceed over a wide-ranging pasture land, spotted and diversified with herds and flocks.

Passing [Box](/stations/box) Station (near which is *Wraxhall House*), we soon after enter a small tunnel, which is cut through Middle Hill, adjoining a once-noted spa, so called, but now quite forsaken. Emerging from tins we pass on an embankment two miles in length that carries the line onward over the Avon into the county of [Somerset](/regions/england/somerset).

The hamlets of Bathford, Bathampton, and Bathenston are now passed in rapid succession, and swerving slightly to the south, the outskirts of the "Stone-built city" itself rise in all their magnificence before us, as if evoked by a magician from the fertile pastures we have so recently quitted. A loud and prolonged whistle is borne upon the air as herald of our arrival, and we enter the elegant and commodious station at [Bath](/stations/bath).

From the Bath station the railway is earned on a viaduct, continued by alternate excavation and embankment, over the Old Bath Road. We soon after pass into an excavation, and then through a tunnel. Amid a succession of very varied and beautiful scenery along the line, we reach the station of [Twerton](/stations/twerton), and soon after, that of [Saltford](/stations/saltford).

An embankment succeeds across the valley of the Avon, and passing over a viaduct we arrive at [Keynsham](/stations/keynsham). The train then passes through several tunnels, and flitting over a three-arched bridge that spans the Avon, we again reach an embankment, during our passage over which our speed is gradually slackened, and we pass beneath that splendid archway, the entrance to [Bristol](/stations/bristol).

text: <span class="smcp">Blenheim Park</span> to the right. A government grant of half a million of money was expended in the erection of a magnificent palace at this place for the Duke of Marlborough in the reign of Queen Anne. Besides a beautiful chapel, it contains a library of more than 17,000 volumes. It also contained a most costly collection of paintings, until recently (1861), the most valuable portion of them having been accidentally destroyed by fire. It is a calamity the nation will deeply deplore. The grounds are laid out with great taste; and the park, which is richly wooded, is about 2,700 acres in extent.

Thence crossing the Evenlode several times in our course, and skirting the park rails of the Duke of Beaufort's princely domain, *Blandford Park*, we arrive at [Charlbury](/stations/charlbury).

text: In the vicinity is *Catton Hall*, seat of Lady Wilmot Horton. *Wichnor Manor*, seat of J. Levett, Esq., was held by Sir R. de Somerville, under the Earl of Lancaster, with the understanding that he should be bound to present a flitch of bacon to every married couple who, after being married a year and a day, should make oath that they had never quarrelled or wished themselves unmarried. Very few claimants are recorded by the most searching historians.

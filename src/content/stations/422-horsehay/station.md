text: Another seat of the Coalbrookdale Company's operations. -- Since the introduction of the method of rolling bars of iron, the forges, and subsequently the furnaces (the lights and smoke from which formerly produced in the valley those appearances which suggested to strangers ideas of unearthly regions) have been removed to this place, as also to other positions in the coalfield--about 17,000 tons of bar iron, of various qualities and descriptions, are annually made here; but the large foundries still carry on in the Dale their busy and extensive manufacture. Perhaps at no other place is there made so great a variety, not only of articles but of patterns of the same article.

W. Ball, who at the age of 55 weighed the extraordinary weight of 560 lbs., was born here.

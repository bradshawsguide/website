text: This place is situated in a pretty spot under Overton Hill. It has a fine old Norman church (from which there is a good view), grammar school graving dock, an old castle given by Edward I, to Llewellyn's brother David, for the betrayal of which he was executed. It was burnt in 1642. It has a population of 1,869, employed in the salt works. Here died T. Hough, aged 141 years; and its inhabitants are celebrated for their longevity.

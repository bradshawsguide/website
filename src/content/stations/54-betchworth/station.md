text: Within a short distance, situated most beautifully in a romantic park washed by the "Sullen Mole," are the ruins of *Betchworth Castle*.

They are most picturesque, and the grey walls, contrasting with the rich green of the ivy creeping over a great part of them, stand out finely against the deep blue sky.

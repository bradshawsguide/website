text: This town is the largest in the county, with the exception of Salisbury. It has a population of 9,626, and is situated on the river Ware. The church is large and highly decorated. It is one of the largest clothing towns in the west of England. Leland says of it, in his time even, "it flourisheth by drapery." Crabbe, the poet, was rector here. George Keats, the poet, was a native. Ruins *Farley Castle* (3½ miles) are very picturesque. A short branch here turns off to [Bradford](/stations/bradford-on-avon).

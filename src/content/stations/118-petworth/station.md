text: This town has a population of 2,326, and occupies a very healthy situation near the river Rother. The principal attraction is *Petworth House*, close by, the superb residence of General Wyndham, formerly that of the Earls of Northumberland. Here are a fine collection of paintings, many by Vandyke, old tapestry and various works of art, together with the sword used by Hotspur at the battle of Shrewsbury. The park, in which the museum stands, is 12 miles in circumference. In the church may be seen many of the tombs of the Percys and Wyndhams.

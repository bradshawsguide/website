text: Wokingham is situated on the River Wey, on the borders of Windsor Forest. The town consists of three streets, with a handsome new Town Hall (modern Gothic) and Market Place in the centre. The Parish Church is picturesque, and undergoing restoration. A new church is also being built by J. Walter, Esq., proprietor of the Times. The railways have given considerable impetus to trade here, and house property has become valuable.

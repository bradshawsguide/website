text: This station is situated in the midst of most beautiful scenery and in view of the Crystal Palace. A small branch railway conveys passengers from the station to the palace, from which a continuation of the same railway will convey them on to Croydon to rejoin the main line, if their destination be onwards. Whether the reader be going on a visit to the palace or merely passing it *en route* to a more distant station, the view of the gleaming dome and marvellous structure, which crowns the breezy heights of Sydenham, will always excite his wonder and admiration.

text: Situate in a fine part of the river, has remains of a castle, and a long bridge. Trout and salmon fishing; fine scenery. Just above it, the *Irvon* joins; it should be ascended for its charming scenery to *Llanwrtyd Wells* (14 miles) and Llandovery (23 miles). When Llewellyn was hemmed in by the English under Mortimer, in Edward I's reign, he tried to get assistance to disguise his movements from the Welsh garrison of Builth Castle. It was in winter, and he had his horse's shoes reversed; this, however, was revealed to the English by the blacksmith. The garrison refused to help him, and as he was retreating up the Ithon, he was surprised and killed. *Bradwyr Buallt* is the designation applied to Builth to this day. The Welsh prince was killed at Cwm-Llewellyn, near the Park Wells; and the body buried at Cefn-y-bedd, a mile or two further on the Llandovery road. There are two roads down the Wye from Builth, the high road being on the west side; but the east road is the most interesting, especially about Aberedw, which lies in a beautiful defile, where the Ebw falls in, opposite Erwood. The castle was Llewellyn's hunting seat. Near it is the church on a cliff, a hole in which is Llewellyn's cave. Further on the Machwy (Little Wye) joins; it should be followed a little way to the Pwll Dwu or Black Rock, and its waterfall, 40 feet down. There are good sulphur springs in this quarter, viz.:--Park Wells, Llanwrtyd Wells, &c., &c.

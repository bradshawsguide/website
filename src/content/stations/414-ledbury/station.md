text: A place remarkable for its manufacture of rope twine, &c., also cider and perry. It stands on the banks of the Leddon, at the foot of the Malvern Hills, and has a fine old Norman Church with a beautiful window and spire. The sexton is a rare oddity, full of wit and anecdote. There is an ancient market house. Hop fields and orchards are seen here, reminding one of Kent. About a mile to the east of the town is situated Eastnor Park, the magnificent residence of Earl Somers, a descendant of the greatlawyer of William III's time, the view from the summit of which is very imposing.

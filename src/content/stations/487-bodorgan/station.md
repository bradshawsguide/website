text: On leaving this station the ancient town of Abcrffraw may be seen on our left. In the neighbourhood of the town there is a splendid lake, two miles in circumference, called *Lhjn Coron*, much frequented by anglers during the summer. Proceeding onwards through ordinary cuttings, over embankments and bridges in succession, we again come in sight of the Holyhead Road, and pass over the river Alaw, on the banks of which, in 1813, was found buried the sepulchral urn containing the remains of Broniventhe, the daughter of Llyr (King Lear), and aunt to the great Caractacus.

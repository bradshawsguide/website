text: In the vicinity is *Needwood Forest*, belonging to the Duchy of Lancaster through King Henry IV. The principal portion is oak timber: (here is the Swilcar Oak, a very ancient tree, 21 feet in girth); *Egginton Heath*, on which Sir J. Gill defeated the royalists in 1644. Near at hand is the *Hall*, the old seat of the Leighs, but now held by Sir H. Every, and quite modernised; and *Tutbury Castle*, on the river Dove, which overflows its banks, but verifies the old adage,

> In April Dove's flood.
> Is worth a king's good.

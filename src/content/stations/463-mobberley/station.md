text: Situated about a mile from the ancient and quaint village of that name, which still boasts the peculiarity, as we are informed, of having two lords of the manor and two manor houses. Here was formerly a priory, which had, however, only a brief existence. Near Mobberley is Dukinfield Hall, said to be formerly the seat of the Daniels, one of which family, a knight, met in mortal combat in the locality of Ashley, his brother-in-law, Captain Ratcliffe, whom he killed. The field in which the fight took place still bears the name of the "Bloody Field."

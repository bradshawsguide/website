text: The Swansea terminus of this line is situated in Wind Street. Taking our departure hence, we very soon arrive at [Briton Ferry](/stations/briton-ferry), prettily situated at the entrance of the river Neath. About 2½ miles further are the extensive remains of a Cistercian Abbey, now accommodated with a station. It
was built by Richard De Granville, in 1129, and is well worth a visit. A mile and a quarter beyond
this brings us to the town of
**[Neath](/stations/neath)**.

We next come to the stations of [Aberdylais](/stations/aberdylais), [Resolven](/stations/resolven), and [Glyn Neath](/stations/glyn-neath). From this point, *Craig-y-linn*, the highest mountain in Glamorganshire, with its lakes and ravines, and which here makes a bold horseshoe sweep, raising its huge bulk against the sky, may be reached.

[Hirwain](/stations/hirwain), junction of line to Aberdare, [Llydcoed](/stations/llydcoed), and [Abernant](/stations/abernant) stations follow, arriving at **[Merthyr Tydvil](/stations/merthyr)**.

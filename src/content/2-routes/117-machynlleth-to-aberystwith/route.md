text: Passing onward from [Machynlleth](/stations/machynlleth), we come to a bend of the river Dovey, on which is situated [Glan Dovey](/stations/glan-dovey) station, and a little further along the widening estuary of the Dovey to

[Ynys-Las](/stations/ynys-las), at which place there is a ferry across the mouth of the river to [Aberdovey](/stations/aberdovey), a small but pretty bathing place. This portion of the Welsh Coast line takes a northerly direction to [Towyn](/stations/towyn).

From hence, leaving the race course to the left, we continue our journey about five miles further to [Llwyngwril](/stations/llwyngwril), and thence to [Barmouth Ferry](/stations/barmouth-ferry), at the mouth of the river Mawddach. The stream, the banks of which present some pretty views, is here crossed to [Barmouth](/stations/barmouth).

On retracing our steps to Ynys-Las we proceed in the direction of Aberystwith to the station of [Borth](/stations/borth), a little village on the edge of an extensive sandy beach. Two and a quarter miles further is the little town of [Llanfihangel](/stations/llanfihangel) a little to the right of which is Sarn Cynfelin, or the Wallag shoal. There are remains of a very old castle, said to have been destroyed in the twelfth century. One and a half mile further brings us to [Bow Street](/stations/bow-street) station, and 4¼ miles more to [Aberystwith](/stations/aberystwith).

text: From Chester we pass [Broughton](/stations/broughton), to the right of which is *Hawarden*, a small market town in Flintshire, with Six S. Glynne's seat, *Hawarden Castle*, which was built in 1752, on the site of the old fortress. It contains old portraits, antiquities, and the ruins of the keep of the old seat which was destroyed in 1678, by Sergeant Glynne, and was a place of great celebrity during the Welsh Wars. We then reach. [Broughton Hall](/stations/broughton-hall), and soon after, the station at [Hope](/stations/hope).

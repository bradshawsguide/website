Text: ## Ashford to Hastings

At Ashford, we bear to the south, through a well-wooded country, arriving at [Ham Street](/stations/ham-street) station, soon after leaving which we cross the Military Canal, which was cut during the French war, at the close of the last century. Its breadth is about 30 yards, 6 feet deep, and extends 23 miles. We now skirt the Romney Marshes, a most valuable tract of land, pass the station at [Appledore](/stations/appledore), and arrive at [Rye](/stations/rye).

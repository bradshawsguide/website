Text: ## Clapham to Kingston

Soon after rejoining the Main Line at Clapham Common, [a branch to the left](/routes/west-end-of-london-and-crystal-palace) leads to the Crystal Palace, *via* [Balham](/stations/balham), [Streatham](/stations/streatham), and [Norwood](/stations/norwood).

Emerging from the excavation, we proceed onwards over an embankment, which affords one continued series of delightful views across a country which art has contributed in the highest degree to adorn, at the extremity of which a cursory glimpse of the old square tower of Kingston church is obtained.

## Weybridge to Woking

From the hill before [Weybridge](/stations/weybridge) to [Woking](/stations/woking), a distance of six miles, there is a gradual descent After crossing the bridge which spans the Basingstoke Canal, here intersected by the canal from Guildford, and passing several villages, we pass over the Woking embankment, whence a succession of picturesque views will delight the traveller. Ottershaw Park affords a pleasing specimen of English forest scenery. The fine effect of these majestic trees, with nothing behind them but the sunny splendour of a summer morning, or the rich glow of an evening sky, realises all that Claude has embodied in his pictures.

## Woking to Basingstoke

From Woking the line shortly crosses the road by a viaduct of one arch, and then enters the Goldworthy Hill excavation, on emerging from which it proceeds over the Frimley embankment, about four miles in length, whence an almost unbounded view of the surrounding country bursts upon the sight.

The eye ranges over one vast landscape of hills and valleys thickly wooded, and presenting a *coup d'&#339;il* of surpassing beauty, above which may be seen the Surrey hills stretching away for miles, and bounding one of nature's panoramas which defy description. Crossing a small streamlet, called Blackwater Brook, we leave the county of Surrey for Hampshire, and passing beneath a road, we reach [Farnborough](/stations/farnborough) Station.

## Basingstoke to Bishopstoke

The line now passes through a country bearing the true Hampshire characteristics of forest scenery, until we reach [Winchester](/stations/winchester).

## Bishopstoke to Southampton

The line traverses a country skirted in each direction by thick woody undulations. On passing [Portswood](/stations/portswood), near to which are the remains of St. Dennis's Priory, and approaching the town, however, the scenery becomes somewhat less interesting.

## Southampton to Dorchester and Weymouth.

This line of railway passes through a country of picturesque character and antiquarian interest. It branches off from the South Western Railway at the upper end of the town of Southampton, and passes through a tunnel under the old road to London. The tunnel is nearly 531 yards in length, and is cut through a soil of gravel and clay. The railway then passes on *vi&#226;* the stations of [Redbridge](/stations/redbridge), [Totton](/stations/totton) (for Eling), and [Lyndhurst Road](/stations/lyndhurst-road), (none of which require special notice), to [Brockenhurst](/stations/brockenhurst).

Text: Barnes is memorable, among other associations, as being the place where Sir Francis Walsingham entertained Queen Elizabeth and her retinue, at an enormous expense, though the next year he died at his house in Seething Lane so poor, that his friends were obliged to bury him privately at night. The church, about a quarter of a mile from the river, is one of the most ancient in the neighbourhood of the metropolis, having been erected in the reign of Richard I. (1189). Here lived Jacob Tonson, the bookseller, the founder and secretary of the Kit-Cat Club.

Text: In the vicinity of this station is that picturesque tract of common land--Putney Heath and Wimbledon Common, so delightful to those who love to see nature in her wildest character. Putney Church is a fine old structure. Across the old wooden bridge is *Fulham*, with its church and palace, the residence of the Bishops of London. It is a plain building, but the grounds are very pretty, and contain some line American trees, planted by Bishop Compton.

On emerging from the cutting and passing this station, we proceed over a level country to Barnes Common, which the line crosses.

Text: Horley was once famous for its iron works. It has traces of an old castle. The church is a fine edifice, and contains some handsome monuments. From the Horley station the line begins for some time rising, and the view on every side continues, as before, uninterrupted.

Four miles beyond, the railway passes over the boundary line into the county of Sussex, and arrives at [Three Bridges](/stations/three-bridges).

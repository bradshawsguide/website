Text: Population, 3,857, engaged principally in the manufacture of buttons, and agriculture. At various periods in its earlier history it has sustained much damage by fire, which had the effect of almost annihilating the place, although now a town of considerable importance. The date of the last fire may be seen on the side of a pump. In the church are monuments to the Pitts.

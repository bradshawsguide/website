text: On the London side of Northfleet, on the left of our line may be seen the beautiful asylum for decayed merchants, founded by the philanthropic merchant, Mr. Huggens, still living, and well known on the London corn exchange.

Northfleet has an ancient church, one of the largest in Kent, containing several monuments of interesting antiquity, among which will be found one to Dr. Brown, physician to Charles II., and some curious brasses of the fourteenth century. The extensive excavations about here, forming a sort of miniature Switzerland, not only give the scenery a wild and romantic aspect, but furnish valuable materials for the potteries.

**Rosherville.--**Hotel: the Rosherville Hotel, first class, family and commercial. Rosherville, though a suburb of Gravesend, belongs parish of Northfleet, and its neat pier seen to the right, forming an elegant communication with that extensive range of buildings erected a few years since on the estate of the late Jeremiah Kosher. The Rosherville Gardens are open daily to the public, at the moderate admission fee of sixpence, and present a combination of attractions, produced by the united agency of nature and art, that leave them almost without a rival. It is absolutely astonishing to see what a fairy-land has been here created out of a chalk-pit. There are gala nights throughout, the summer, when fireworks, music, and illuminations are added to the other enchantments of the spot. The Clifton Baths; on what is called "The Parade," are commodiously fitted up for cold, shower, warm, and vapour bathing, and seem to have been built in grotesque mimicry of the Pavilion at Brighton.

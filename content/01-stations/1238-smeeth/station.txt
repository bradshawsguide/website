Text: In this neighbourhood is *Merstham Hatch*, the property of the Knatchbull family since the reign of Henry VII. The mansion is a modern building, of considerable architectural beauty, situated in a very fine park, and the interior is most elegantly fitted up.

*Mount Morris*, the seat of Lord Rokeby, is in a splendid park, the heights of which command extensive views of the South Downs, the Channel, and the coast of France.

From this point the line passes almost immediately to the north of the extensive level of Romney Marsh, which may occasionally be seen from the carriages.

Text: This place is celebrated for it race course on the Heath (nearly 2 miles in circuit), with a Royal Grand Stand, two stables, large coach house, commodious weighing houses, &c., all constructed by the Duke of Cumberland. The sport at these races is first-rate. They are generally attended by the Royal Family in state, and the elite of the court, nobility, and fashion of England.

Twenty years ago Ascot Heath was as wild a district as any in Great Britain, with hardly a house visible from it but the Royal Kennels, and an apology for a race stand. Now the buildings appropriated to the turf form a little city of Olympian palaces, the most complete range of racing Chateaux extant. The sport, too, is indeed worthy of being set before a Sovereign. On most occasions there are upwards of thirty races, some of them bringing together the best horses in the land, and the whole generally go off with considerable &#233;clat.

Further on a little to the right, is Binfield and its beechwoods, all beautiful. Indeed the whole of Berkshire, from end to end, abounds in endless attractions to the lover of country scenery.

We shortly after reach [Bracknell](bracknell) station, containing a population of 108. It has a pretty modern church, built by Coe.

Text: This place stands on the river Adur, at the foot of a hill. It enjoyed the privileges of a borough by prescriptive right, and returned two members to parliament up to the passing of the Reform Bill, by which it was disfranchised. It has some very old houses, and a church with some genuine Norman features, although its origin must have been in the earliest Saxon period, being the church of a benedictine monastery, in which were buried St. Cuthman and the father of Alfred the Great.

Text: Leaving the station we enter a deep excavation, and soon after a short tunnel; a lofty embankment follows, which presents us with a series of delightful prospects, amongst which the Odiham hills and their singular clump of trees on the summit figure conspicuously on the left.

Prior to entering on the Hook Common excavation we pass beneath Odiham bridge, which leads to the seat of the late and present Duke of Wellington, Strathfieldsaye, situated about six miles off to the right.

The Heriot hills, crested by lofty firs, soon burst into view, and not long after we pass the interesting ruins of Old Basing, which was, in the Saxon era, a place of considerable note, and the scene of contests during the civil wars. The viaduct the line now passes over affords a good view of the old town, and a short distance beyond we reach [Baskingstoke](baskingstoke).

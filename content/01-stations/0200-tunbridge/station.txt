Text: Situated on the Tun and four branches of the Medway, all crossed by bridges. It is noted for its excellent Grammar School with sixteen exhibitions. The castle, of which a fine noble gateway flanked by round towers still remains, was built by Richard Fitz Gilbert, Earl of Clare and Hertford, who likewise founded a priory here for Augustine Canons, the refectory of which may be seen. Open on Saturdays from 10 till 4, by permission of the proprietor.

This, besides being the branch station for passengers to Tunbridge Wells, has a convenient refreshment-room appended.

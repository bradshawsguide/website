Text: Barking is a market town in the county of Essex, so called from a creek on which it is situated. The town is of considerable extent, and chiefly inhabited by fishermen, by whom the fish markets of London are frequently supplied. The parish is divided into four wards of Barking, Great Ilford, Chadwell, and Rippleward, abounding with fertile lands and beautiful prospects. A fair is held here annually, round a famous oak denominated Fairlop. This oak sustained its dignity in the forest for many years, and though it has suffered from the rough treatment of visitors, it still maintains a majestic appearance peculiar to itself. The Westmoreland's seat at East Ham belonged to Anne Boleyn.

The route from Bishopsgate, via Ilford, unites here, when the trains proceed together, via [Rainham](rainham), to [Purfleet](purfleet).

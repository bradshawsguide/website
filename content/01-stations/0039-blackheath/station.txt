Text: This heath is celebrated for many remarkable events that have been witnessed on it in former periods of our history. The Danes encamped here while their fleet lay in the Thames a little above Woolwich. Wat Tyler and Jack Cade also encamped here with their followers, and since then the exploits of highwaymen and others have rendered the heath equally notorious. But it is now a favourite resort of the inhabitants of London, who come in crowds during the holidays and summer season—donkey riding being a favourite amusement. The heath is exceedingly picturesque, and commands several very fine views. *Lee* and its church to the right.

From this station we pass through a tunnel 1,680 yards long, and arrive at [Charlton](charlton).

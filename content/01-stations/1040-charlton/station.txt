Text: Charlton is a small village, most pleasantly situated, and remarkable for the numerous picturesque villas and residences it contains. From its being in the vicinity of Woolwich, and its charming neighbourhood, it is much frequented whenever a review or other military spectacle attracts visitors from town.

Pursuing our course we pass through two more tunnels, respectively 100 and 120 yards long, and arrive at [Woolwich Dock](/stations/woolwich-dock) Station, a short distance from which is [Woolwich Arsenal](/stations/woolwich-arsenal) Station.
